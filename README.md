# Feature-Selection-Causal-Inference

Feature Selection for Causal Inference from High Dimensional Observational Data with Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net

Authors: Md saiful Islam, Sahil Shikalgar, Md. Noor-E-Alam

We propose an Outcome Adaptive Elastic-Net (OAENet) method specifically designed for causal inference to select the confounders and outcome predictors for inclusion in the propensity score model or in the matching mechanism.
OAENet provides two major advantages over existing methods: it performs superiorly on correlated data, and it can be applied to any matching method and any estimates
